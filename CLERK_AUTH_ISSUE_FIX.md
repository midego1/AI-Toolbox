# 🔧 Clerk Auth Issue Fix

## Problem

After signing in with Google via Clerk, you're stuck on the homepage instead of being redirected to dashboard.

## Root Causes

1. **No redirect configured** - Clerk didn't know where to send you after login
2. **Public homepage doesn't check auth** - Homepage doesn't redirect authenticated users
3. **User sync missing** - User created in Clerk but not in Convex yet

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Configured Clerk Redirects
- **Login**: `afterSignInUrl="/dashboard"` 
- **Signup**: `afterSignUpUrl="/dashboard"`
- **Routing**: `routing="path"` for proper URL handling

### 2. Homepage Auto-Redirect
- Checks if user is signed in with Clerk
- Automatically redirects to `/dashboard`
- Prevents authenticated users from seeing public page

### 3. Backend Compatibility
- `verifySession()` accepts Convex user IDs
- Old token auth still works
- Both auth methods supported

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Sign in again** - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. **Use Google** - Click "Sign in with Google"
3. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/dashboard`
4. **If on homepage**: Should auto-redirect to dashboard

## 📊 Current Status

### What Should Work
- ✅ Sign in → Dashboard redirect
- ✅ Sign up → Dashboard redirect  
- ✅ Homepage → Auto-redirect if signed in
- ✅ Dashboard → Shows content (if user exists in Convex)

### Potential Issue
If dashboard still shows preview mode (blurred):
- User not created in Convex yet
- Webhook not triggered
- Need to manually create user

## 🔍 Debug Steps

1. **Check Convex Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
   - Check `users` table
   - Look for your email

2. **If no user exists**:
   - Webhook not configured in Clerk
   - OR webhook failed to deliver
   - Need to create user manually

3. **Test the dashboard**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard directly
   - Should auto-redirect to login if not signed in
   - OR show preview mode if signed in but no Convex user

## 🎯 Quick Fix (If Stuck)

If you're signed in with Clerk but stuck on homepage:

**Option 1**: Visit dashboard directly
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

**Option 2**: Check Convex for your user
```
https://dashboard.convex.dev → Data → users
```

**Option 3**: Clear cookies and try again
```
1. Sign out from Clerk
2. Clear browser cookies
3. Sign in again
4. Check webhook delivery
```

**The redirect issue should be fixed now. Try signing in again!** 🎉
