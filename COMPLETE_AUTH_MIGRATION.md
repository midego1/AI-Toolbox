# ✅ Complete Auth Migration - Clerk Only

## Summary of Changes

### ✅ Logout Fixed
- **Before**: Used old Convex `api.auth.logout` mutation
- **After**: Uses Clerk's `signOut()` from `useClerk()`
- **Result**: Properly signs out from Clerk and clears session

### ✅ Files Updated
1. **`src/components/layout/dashboard-header.tsx`**
   - Added `useClerk` import from `@clerk/nextjs`
   - Replaced old `api.auth.logout` with `signOut()`
   - Removed unused legacy auth imports

---

## How Logout Works Now

### User Clicks "Sign Out"
1. Triggers `handleSignOut()`
2. Calls `await signOut()` from Clerk
3. Clerk clears:
   - Browser session
   - Auth tokens
   - Cookies
4. Redirects to homepage (configurable)

### The Code:
```typescript
const { signOut } = useClerk();

const handleSignOut = async () => {
  try {
    await signOut();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Sign out error:", error);
    router.push("/");
  }
};
```

## Auth System Status

### ✅ Using Clerk
- Sign in ✅
- Sign up ✅
- Sign out ✅
- User creation ✅
- Token management ✅

### ❌ NOT Using (Legacy)
- ~~`getAuthToken()`~~ (only as fallback in `useAuthToken`)
- ~~`api.auth.logout`~~
- ~~`api.auth.login`~~
- ~~Sessions table~~

### 📝 Still Referenced (Compatibility)
- `getAuthToken()` - Used for backward compatibility
- `useAuthToken()` - Returns Clerk user ID
- Old mutations still exist in Convex (not called)

---

## Testing Logout

**Steps:**
1. Sign in with Clerk
2. Go to dashboard
3. Click user menu (top right)
4. Click "Sign Out" / "Log out"
5. Should redirect to homepage
6. Try accessing `/dashboard` directly
7. Should redirect back to login

**Expected:**
- ✅ Signs out cleanly
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ Clears all auth data
- ✅ Redirects properly

---

## Remaining Legacy Code

### Still Using `getAuthToken()` (for compatibility):
These files use it but it returns Clerk user ID via `useAuthToken`:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/tools/chat/page.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/admin/page.tsx`
- And many more tool pages...

**This is OK** because:
- `useAuthToken()` provides Clerk user ID
- Backward compatible with existing code
- No need to update every file
- Works transparently

### Old Convex Auth Files (Not Removed):
- `convex/auth.ts` - Still has `login`, `logout` mutations
- Not called from anywhere (Clerk handles it)
- Kept for potential backward compatibility

### ✅ User Creation
- Instant sync (client-side)
- Webhook backup
- Email matching
- Credits initialized

### ✅ Sign Out
- Clears Clerk session
- Removes cookies
- Redirects properly
- No lingering state

### ✅ Middleware (Optional)
Could add Clerk middleware for:
- Route protection
- Auto-redirect
- Better UX
