# Digital Wardrobe - Virtual Try-On Feature

## Overview

The Digital Wardrobe is an AI-powered virtual try-on tool that allows users to upload a photo of themselves and a clothing item, then generates a realistic image showing them wearing that clothing.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Virtual Try-On
- Upload your photo (full body or upper body recommended)
- Upload a photo of any clothing item
- AI generates a realistic composite image
- Multiple style options (realistic, fashion photography, magazine editorial, casual)

## How It Works

### 1. **Image Upload**
Users upload two images:
- **Person Photo**: A clear photo of yourself (preferably full body or upper body)
- **Clothing Item**: A clear photo of the clothing piece you want to try on

### 2. **AI Analysis**
The system uses AI to:
- Analyze the person's pose, body type, and current setting
- Analyze the clothing item's style, color, pattern, and fabric texture
- Generate a detailed prompt for realistic virtual try-on

### 3. **Image Generation**
- Uses OpenRouter with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
- Generates a photorealistic composite image
- Applies proper fit, draping, lighting, and shadows
- Saves the result to Convex storage

### 4. **Download & Share**
- View the generated image
- Download in high quality
- Try multiple clothing items
