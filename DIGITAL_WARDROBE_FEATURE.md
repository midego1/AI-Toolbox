## How It Works

### 1. **Image Upload**
Users upload two images:
- **Person Photo**: A clear photo of yourself (preferably full body or upper body)
- **Clothing Item**: A clear photo of the clothing piece you want to try on

### 2. **Intelligent Item Type Detection**
User selects the item type for optimized results:
- **Accessories**: Focus on preserving exact facial features while seamlessly adding the item
- **Clothing**: Balance between maintaining appearance and visualizing the new garment
- **Footwear**: Preserve upper body completely while showing new shoes

### 3. **Image-to-Image Processing (v3.0)**
The system now uses TRUE image-to-image generation:
- **Sends both actual photos to the AI model** (not text descriptions!)
- AI receives your photo and the item photo as visual data
- Model can SEE your facial features, not just read about them
- Multimodal processing: text instructions + 2 image inputs

### 3.5 **AI Visual Analysis**
The AI model (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) analyzes:
- Your exact facial features, pose, body type, and setting
- The fashion item's style, color, pattern, and fabric texture
- Spatial relationships for natural compositing
- Lighting and perspective matching
- Type-specific instructions (e.g., "preserve facial features" for accessories)

### 4. **Image Generation**
- Uses OpenRouter with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
- Generates a photorealistic composite image
- Applies proper fit, draping, lighting, and shadows
- Saves the result to Convex storage

### 5. **Download & Share**
- View the generated image
- Download in high quality
- Try multiple clothing items
