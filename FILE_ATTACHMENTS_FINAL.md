## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend Changes:**
```typescript
// Get file URLs from storage
const fileUrls = await Promise.all(
  fileIds.map(async (fileId: string) => {
    const url = await ctx.storage.getUrl(fileId as any);
    return url;
  })
);

// Format for vision-capable models
userContent = [
  { type: "text", text: message },
  ...fileUrls.map((url) => ({
    type: "image_url",
    image_url: { url },
  })),
];
```

### **Frontend Changes:**
```typescript
// Get image URL
const getImageUrl = (storageId: string) => {
  const convexUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL;
  return `${convexUrl}/api/storage/${storageId}`;
};

// Display images
<img src={getImageUrl(fileId)} alt="Attached file" />
```
