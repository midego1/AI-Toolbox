# ✅ Font Size Consistency - Fixed

## What Was Changed

### **Font Size Optimization**
Updated the chat interface to use larger, more readable font sizes that match the rest of the platform.

### **Changes Made:**

#### **Before:**
- `prose-sm` - Small prose size (too small for readability)
- `text-sm` - Small text (14px)
- `text-base` - Standard text

#### **After:**
- `prose-lg` - Large prose size (better readability)
- `text-base` - Standard text (16px, default)
- `text-base` - Consistent across platform
