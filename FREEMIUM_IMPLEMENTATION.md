# Freemium Platform Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the freemium-first approach implemented for the platform, allowing users to browse and explore tools without requiring authentication, while maintaining the subscription model for actual usage.

## Key Changes

### 1. Three-Tier Tool System

**Anonymous Tools** (No auth required to browse):
- Translation
- Summarizer
- Rewriter
- OCR
- Transcription

**Free Tools** (Require sign-in, free to use):
- Chat
- Sinterklaas tools (Gedichten, Cadeautips, Surprises)

**Premium Tools** (Require Pro subscription):
- Image Generation
- Background Remover
- Digital Wardrobe
- Copywriting
- SEO Optimizer
- LinkedIn Content

### 2. Updated Landing Page

The public landing page (`src/app/(public)/page.tsx`) now:
- Shows quick access to free tools at the top
- Minimal signup prompts (placed subtlely)
- Focus on tool discovery rather than signup conversion
- Users can click on tools immediately without barriers

### 3. Guest Preview Mode

The dashboard layout (`src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) now:
- Allows unauthenticated users to browse the dashboard
- Shows a subtle guest banner instead of full-screen blur
- All tools are accessible but require sign-in to actually use
- No aggressive signup walls

### 4. Subtle Upgrade Prompts

Each tool page now shows:
- A gentle banner for unauthenticated users
- Clear CTA to sign in when they try to use a tool
- No blocking/preventing access to the UI
- Value proposition: "Save your work & get 100 free credits"

## User Flow

### Anonymous User Journey

1. **Landing Page** → User sees tools, clicks "Translation"
2. **Dashboard Layout** → Guest banner shows "Using as guest, sign in to save"
3. **Tool Page** → User can see the UI, enter text, but needs sign-in to translate
4. **Gentle Prompt** → When they click translate, see banner encouraging signup
5. **Value Realization** → "I've already entered my text, I should sign up to use it"

### Authenticated User Journey

1. User signs up/logs in
2. Full access to their tool
3. Saves work automatically
4. Can upgrade to Pro for premium tools

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reduced Friction** → Users can explore before committing
2. **Better SEO** → All tool pages are accessible to crawlers
3. **Higher Intent Signups** → Users sign up when they have actual value to preserve
4. **No Aggressive CTAs** → Builds trust, doesn't feel scammy
5. **Clear Value Prop** → Free credits + save work is compelling

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. `src/lib/premium-tools.ts` - Three-tier system
2. `src/app/(public)/page.tsx` - Tool-focused landing
3. `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Guest preview mode
4. `src/app/(dashboard)/tools/*/page.tsx` - Individual tool upgrade prompts
5. `src/components/layout/guest-upgrade-banner.tsx` - Reusable component

### Key Patterns

```typescript
// Check if user is signed in
const { isSignedIn } = useUser();

// Show prompt if not signed in
{!isSignedIn && (
  <div className="upgrade-banner">
    <p>Sign in to use this tool</p>
    <Link href="/signup">Sign Up Free</Link>
  </div>
)}

// Disable action if not signed in
const handleAction = async () => {
  if (!isSignedIn) {
    alert("Please sign in");
    return;
  }
  // ... continue
};
```

## Testing Checklist

## Marketing Copy

## Next Steps

3. Add "Try as guest" option with localStorage temporary storage
4. Implement email capture before requiring signup
5. Add testimonial social proof near upgrade prompts
