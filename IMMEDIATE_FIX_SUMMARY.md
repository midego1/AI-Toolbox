# Immediate Fix Summary

## The Problem
Admin page was stuck showing "Verifying admin access..." spinner.

## The Root Cause
1. ✅ Convex URL is configured: `https://diligent-warbler-176.convex.cloud`
2. ✅ Convex is running (multiple processes)
3. ❌ **Next.js dev server was NOT running!**

## The Solution
Started Next.js development server with `npm run dev`.

## What to Do Now

1. **Wait 10-20 seconds** for the server to start
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
3. Navigate to: Settings → Admin
4. You should now see the debug screen showing:
   - User Found status
   - Admin Status (true/false)
   - Clerk connection status

## After You See the Debug Screen

If you see "Admin Status: ❌ False":
1. Go to Convex Dashboard: https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select your project: ai-toolbox
3. Go to Data → users table
4. Find your user by email
5. Click the `isAdmin` field
6. Set it to `true`
7. Refresh the page

## Expected Result
You should now see the admin page working! 🎉
