# Premium Features with Frost Effect Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive premium tool management system with a frost/blur effect that consistently applies to premium-only tools across the entire application, whether users are logged in (as free users) or not logged in.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Premium Tool Management (`src/lib/premium-tools.ts`)
Created a centralized system to define which tools require premium subscriptions:

**Premium Tools (Require Pro/Enterprise):**
- Image Generation
- Background Removal
- Digital Wardrobe (Virtual Try-On)
- Headshot
- Copywriter Studio
- SEO Optimizer
- LinkedIn Content

**Free Tools (Available to All):**
- Translation
- OCR
- Transcription
- Rewriter
- Summarizer
- AI Chat
- Sinterklaas Tools (Gedichten, Cadeautips, Surprises)

### 2. Premium Overlay Component (`src/components/layout/premium-overlay.tsx`)
- Automatically detects if user has access to premium tools
- Applies blur/frost effect to locked tools
- Shows upgrade overlay with call-to-action
- Works for both logged-in (free tier) and non-logged-in users
- Seamlessly integrates with existing UI

### 3. Implementation Details

#### How It Works:
1. Each tool page wraps its content with `<PremiumOverlay toolId="tool-name">`
2. Component checks user's subscription tier
3. If user doesn't have access (free tier accessing premium tool or not logged in):
   - Applies blur effect to content
   - Shows preview overlay with upgrade prompt
4. If user has access (Pro/Enterprise):
   - Shows content normally without any restrictions

#### Code Example:
```tsx
import { PremiumOverlay } from "@/components/layout/premium-overlay";

export default function ImageGenerationPage() {
  return (
    <PremiumOverlay toolId="image-generation">
      {/* Tool content here */}
    </PremiumOverlay>
  );
}
```

## Currently Implemented

‚úÖ **Image Generation** - Wrapped with PremiumOverlay
- Free users see blurred version with upgrade prompt
- Pro/Enterprise users access normally

## Still To Implement

üìù **Wrap Remaining Premium Tools:**
- Background Removal (`/tools/background-removal`)
- Digital Wardrobe (`/tools/wardrobe`)
- Headshot (`/tools/headshot`)
- Copywriter Studio (`/tools/copywriting`)
- SEO Optimizer (`/tools/seo-optimizer`)
- LinkedIn Content (`/tools/linkedin-content`)

## How to Add Premium Overlay to Other Tools

### Step 1: Import the Component
```tsx
import { PremiumOverlay } from "@/components/layout/premium-overlay";
```

### Step 2: Wrap Your Tool's Content
```tsx
export default function MyToolPage() {
  return (
    <PremiumOverlay toolId="tool-id">
      {/* All your tool content here */}
    </PremiumOverlay>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Premium Status
Make sure your tool ID is in the `PREMIUM_TOOLS` set in `src/lib/premium-tools.ts`

## User Experience

### For Non-Logged-In Users
- ‚úÖ See all premium tools with frost/blur effect
- ‚úÖ See upgrade prompt overlay
- Can click to sign up

### For Free Users (Logged In)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more premium tools to the set
2. Create tiered access (some tools for Pro, others for Enterprise only)

## Testing

1. Login as a free user or don't login at all

4. Login as Pro/Enterprise user (or upgrade account)
5. Navigate to same tool
6. Should see full access without any overlays
