# 🔄 Restart Development Server

The OpenAI API key has been set in the Convex environment, but the development server needs to be restarted to pick up the new environment variable.

## Solution

**Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C) and restart it:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or if using Convex dev separately:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

## Why This Is Needed

Environment variables are loaded when the Convex deployment starts. After setting a new variable, you need to restart to load it.

## Status

✅ OpenAI API key is set in Convex environment
⚠️ Need to restart dev server to use it

## After Restart

The voicemail feature will:
1. Generate personalized scripts (Gemini Flash)
2. Convert to speech (OpenAI TTS)  
3. Store audio in Convex
4. Return playable MP3 audio
