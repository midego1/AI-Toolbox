# 🚀 START HERE - AI Toolbox Quick Start

## ⚡ TL;DR - Run These Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start Convex backend (Terminal 1 - keep running!)
npx convex dev

# 3. In a NEW terminal, start Next.js (Terminal 2)
npm run dev

# 4. Open browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! 🎉

## 📋 What Just Happened?

### Terminal 1: `npx convex dev`
- ✅ Created your Convex backend project
- ✅ Deployed database schema (users, sessions, credits, AI jobs)
- ✅ Deployed all backend functions (auth, AI tools, file storage)
- ✅ Generated TypeScript types in `convex/_generated/`
- ✅ Gave you a development URL (e.g., `https://happy-animal-123.convex.cloud`)
- 🔄 Watching for changes to your backend code

### Terminal 2: `npm run dev`
- ✅ Started Next.js development server
- ✅ Connected to your Convex backend
- ✅ Hot reloading enabled for React components
- 🌐 Running at http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 Testing the App

### 1. Create an Account
1. Click "Get Started" or go to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Sign up with any email/password
3. You automatically get **100 free credits**

### 2. Try AI Tools (Mock Mode - No API Keys Needed!)

All tools work immediately with mock responses:

**Translation** (`/tools/translation`)
- Translates text between languages
- Uses mock: Prefixes text with `[TARGET_LANG]`
- Cost: ~1 credit per 100 characters

**OCR** (`/tools/ocr`)
- Extracts text from images
- Uses mock: Returns "This is mock OCR text..."
- Cost: 5 credits per image

**Image Generation** (`/tools/image-generation`)
- Creates AI-generated images
- Uses mock: Shows placeholder image
- Cost: 10-20 credits per image

### 3. Check Your Credits
- Top right corner shows current balance
- Deducted in real-time as you use tools
- Go to `/billing` to see transaction history

## 🔑 Adding Real AI APIs (Optional)

To use REAL AI services instead of mocks:

### Edit `.env.local`:

```env
# Your Convex URL (auto-set by convex dev)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL="https://your-deployment.convex.cloud"

# OpenAI for Image Generation
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."

# Google Cloud Vision for OCR
GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY="AIza..."

# DeepL for Translation
DEEPL_API_KEY="..."
```

**Where to get keys:**
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Google Cloud: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- DeepL: https://www.deepl.com/pro-api

Restart the dev server after adding keys.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Normal Development
Keep **both terminals running**:

**Terminal 1:** Backend
```bash
npx convex dev
```
- Auto-reloads when you edit `convex/*.ts` files
- Shows backend function logs
- Database changes reflected immediately

**Terminal 2:** Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Auto-reloads when you edit `src/**/*.tsx` files
- Shows React component logs
- UI updates immediately

### View Database
While `convex dev` is running:

```bash
npx convex dashboard
```

Opens web dashboard where you can:
- ✅ View all database tables
- ✅ See user accounts, credits, AI jobs
- ✅ Run queries manually
- ✅ View function execution logs
- ✅ Monitor real-time updates

## ❓ Common Issues

### Issue: "Module not found: convex/_generated/api"

**Cause:** You haven't run `npx convex dev` yet

**Solution:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
npx convex dev

# Wait for "Watching for changes..."

# Terminal 2
npm run dev
```

---

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Convex"

**Cause:** Convex dev server not running

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure Terminal 1 is running:
npx convex dev

# Should see:
# ✔ Deployment URL: https://...
# ✔ Watching for changes...
```

---

### Issue: Build fails

**Cause:** Trying to build before running `convex dev`

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Run convex dev first to generate files
npx convex dev

# 2. Then build
npm run build
```

---

### Issue: "Invalid or expired session"

**Cause:** Logged out or session expired (30 days)

**Solution:**
- Just log back in at http://localhost:3000/login
