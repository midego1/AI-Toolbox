## Architecture

### Payment Flow

```
User Action → Frontend → API Route → Convex Action → Stripe API
                                          ↓
                                    Redirect to Checkout
                                          ↓
                                    Payment Complete
                                          ↓
Stripe Webhook → API Route → Convex Action → Update Database
```

### Data Model

The integration uses the existing schema:

**Users Table**:
- `stripeCustomerId` - Links user to Stripe customer
- `subscriptionTier` - Current tier (free/pro/enterprise)
- `creditsBalance` - Available credits

**Subscriptions Table**:
- `stripeSubscriptionId` - Stripe subscription ID
- `stripePriceId` - Stripe price ID
- `status` - active/canceled/past_due
- `currentPeriodStart/End` - Billing period
- `cancelAtPeriodEnd` - Cancellation flag

**Credit Transactions Table**:
- `stripePaymentIntentId` - Links to Stripe payment
- `type` - purchase/subscription/tool_usage
- `amount` - Credits added/deducted
- `description` - Transaction description
