- ✅ `IMAGE_TO_IMAGE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Quick summary
- ✅ `V3_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - This file

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `/convex/lib/openrouter.ts` - Added `generateImageFromImages()` function
- ✅ `/convex/tools/wardrobe.ts` - Updated to use image-to-image
- ✅ `/DIGITAL_WARDROBE_FEATURE.md` - Updated documentation

### Linting Status:
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ All functions properly typed

## 🔧 What Changed Technically

### 1. New Image-to-Image Function
**Location**: `/convex/lib/openrouter.ts` (lines ~110-240)

**Function Signature**:
```typescript
export async function generateImageFromImages(
  personImageUrl: string,
  itemImageUrl: string,
  instructions: string
): Promise<string>
```

**What It Does**:
- Takes two image URLs from Convex storage
- Sends both as visual data to OpenRouter/Gemini
- Includes text instructions
- Returns base64 data URL of generated composite

**API Format**:
```json
{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "instructions" },
      { "type": "image_url", "image_url": { "url": "person_url" } },
      { "type": "image_url", "image_url": { "url": "item_url" } }
    ]
  }],
  "modalities": ["image", "text"]
}
```

### 2. Updated Wardrobe Tool
**Location**: `/convex/tools/wardrobe.ts` (lines ~147-176)

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed: Text prompt generation via `callOpenRouter()`
- ❌ Removed: `generateImage(textPrompt)` call
- ✅ Added: Direct image-to-image instructions
- ✅ Added: `generateImageFromImages(personUrl, itemUrl, instructions)` call

**New Flow**:
```
1. Get person image URL from storage
2. Get item image URL from storage
3. Create item-type specific instructions
4. Call generateImageFromImages() with both URLs
5. Receive composite image
6. Store and return result
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before (v1.0, v2.0):
```
Input: Your photo + Glasses
Process: Text description → AI generation
Output: Random person with glasses ❌
```

### After (v3.0):
```
Input: Your photo + Glasses
Process: Both images → AI visual analysis → Composite
Output: YOU with glasses ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing:
- [ ] Upload male headshot + glasses → Should show same male with glasses
- [ ] Upload female headshot + glasses → Should show same female with glasses
- [ ] Try accessories type → Should preserve facial features
- [ ] Try upper-body type → Should show clothing change
- [ ] Check credits deduction (15 credits)
- [ ] Verify image downloads properly
- [ ] Test error handling (bad images, no credits, etc.)

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Very dark/light photos
- [ ] Extreme angles
- [ ] Low quality images
- [ ] Already wearing glasses in person photo
- [ ] Multiple items in item photo

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Good Result:
- ✅ Same person (recognizable facial features)
- ✅ Correct gender
- ✅ Glasses/item added naturally
- ✅ Lighting matched
- ✅ Pose maintained

### Acceptable Result:
- ✅ Same general appearance
- ✅ Item visible and integrated
- ⚠️ Some variation in details
- ⚠️ May need retries

### Failed Result (Should Not Happen):
- ❌ Completely different person
- ❌ Wrong gender
- ❌ No item visible
- ❌ Corrupted image

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Convex Functions:
```bash
npx convex deploy
```

### 2. Verify Deployment:
- Check Convex dashboard
- Verify functions deployed
- Check for any errors

### 3. Test in Production:
- Try glasses try-on with real photos
- Verify results
- Check credit deduction
- Test file storage

### 4. Monitor Logs:
- Check Convex logs for errors
- Monitor OpenRouter API responses
- Watch for failed generations

## 🔍 Debugging

### If Results Still Show Different Person:

**Check Logs For**:
1. Are image URLs being retrieved? 
   - Look for: "✅ Retrieved image URLs"
2. Is image-to-image function being called?
   - Look for: "🎨 IMAGE-TO-IMAGE GENERATION STARTING"
3. Are images being sent to API?
   - Look for: "📤 Request with 2 input images"
4. What's the API response?
   - Look for: "📥 Response status: 200"

**Common Issues**:
- Image URLs expired (Convex storage issue)
- API not supporting image inputs (model issue)
- Images not accessible (permissions issue)
- Model not understanding instructions (prompt issue)

### Fallback Plan:
If Gemini 2.5 Flash Image doesn't support this:
- Try different model (Flux, SD-XL with ControlNet)
- Use specialized virtual try-on API
- Implement client-side image overlay
- Add disclaimer about results

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Per Generation:
- **Credits**: 15 (unchanged)
- **API Cost**: ~$0.039 per image (Gemini pricing)
- **Storage**: Minimal (Convex storage)

### Expected Volume:
If 100 users try 5 times each:
- Total: 500 generations
- Credits: 7,500
- API cost: ~$19.50
