# ðŸ”§ Voicemail Authentication Fix

## Issue
The voicemail feature was throwing an "Not authenticated" error because it was using the old auth method that only worked with session tokens, not with Clerk auth which passes Convex user IDs.

## Fix Applied

### Changed Authentication Method

**Before**:
```typescript
const user = await ctx.runQuery(api.auth.getCurrentUser, { token: args.token });
if (!user) {
  throw new Error("Not authenticated");
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
const userId = await ctx.runMutation(api.auth.getUserIdFromToken, { token: args.token });
const user = await ctx.runQuery(api.clerk.getUserProfileById, { userId });
if (!user) {
  throw new Error("User not found");
}
```

### Why This Works

1. `getUserIdFromToken` uses the `verifySession` helper which supports BOTH:
   - Clerk auth (passes Convex user ID directly)
   - Legacy session tokens

2. Then fetches full user profile using the user ID

3. This approach is compatible with the current Clerk authentication system

## Status
âœ… **Fixed and deployed**
- Build successful
- No lint errors
- Ready to use!

## How to Test
1. Navigate to Sinterklaas Tools in sidebar
2. Click "Sinterklaas Voicemail"
3. Fill in the form
4. Click "Genereer Voicemail"
5. Should now work without authentication errors!
