## 4. The Real Solution

The admin access issue is because your user account in Convex doesn't have `isAdmin: true` set.

**To fix it:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select project: ai-toolbox  
3. Go to Data ‚Üí users table
4. Find your user (by email)
5. Click the `isAdmin` field
6. Change it from `false` to `true`
7. Save
8. Refresh the page

You'll then have admin access! üéâ
